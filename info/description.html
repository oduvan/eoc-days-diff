    How old are you in number of days? It's easy to calculate - just subtract your birthday from today. We could make
    this a real challenge though and count the difference between any dates.
</p>

<p>
    You are given two dates as array with three numbers - year, month and day. For example: 19 April 1982 will be
    (1982, 4, 19). You should find the difference in days between the given dates. For example between today and
    tomorrow = 1 day. The difference will always be either a positive number or zero, so don't forget about absolute
    value.

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Two dates as {% if interpreter.slug == "js-node" %}arrays of integers{% else %}tuples of integers{% endif %}.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The difference between the dates in days as an integer.

    Python has batteries included, so in this mission you will need to learn how to use completed modules so that you
    don't have to invent the bicycle all over again.
